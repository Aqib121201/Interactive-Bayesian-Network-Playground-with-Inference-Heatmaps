# Interactive Bayesian Network Playground with Inference Visualizations

## 🧠 Abstract

This project implements an interactive web-based interface for constructing, visualizing, and performing inference on Bayesian Networks. The system provides an intuitive graphical interface for defining network topology, conditional probability tables (CPTs), and running various inference algorithms. Advanced visualization capabilities include likelihood heatmaps, belief propagation animations, and real-time inference results. The implementation leverages pgmpy for robust probabilistic inference and Streamlit for responsive web deployment, enabling both educational and research applications in probabilistic reasoning.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Bayesian Networks are powerful tools for modeling probabilistic relationships between variables, with applications spanning medical diagnosis, risk assessment, and decision support systems. However, existing tools often lack intuitive interfaces for network construction and limited visualization capabilities for understanding inference processes. This project addresses the need for an accessible, interactive platform that enables users to:

- Visually construct Bayesian Networks through drag-and-drop interfaces
- Define and validate conditional probability distributions
- Perform various types of inference (exact and approximate)
- Visualize inference results through heatmaps and belief propagation
- Understand the impact of evidence on network beliefs

**Research Context**: Interactive Bayesian Network tools are crucial for educational purposes and applied research in artificial intelligence, particularly in domains requiring interpretable probabilistic reasoning.

## 📊 Dataset Description

The project includes several pre-built Bayesian Network examples:

- **Medical Diagnosis Network**: 8 nodes representing symptoms and diseases
- **Student Performance Network**: 6 nodes modeling academic factors
- **Weather Prediction Network**: 5 nodes for meteorological variables
- **Custom Networks**: User-defined networks with arbitrary topology

**Source**: Networks are constructed based on domain knowledge and simplified for educational purposes. CPTs are designed to demonstrate realistic probabilistic relationships while maintaining computational tractability.

**Preprocessing**: All networks undergo validation to ensure acyclic structure and proper probability distributions (summing to 1.0 for each CPT).

## 🧪 Methodology

### Core Architecture
The system employs a modular architecture with three primary components:

1. **Frontend Interface** (Streamlit): Interactive network construction and visualization
2. **Inference Engine** (pgmpy): Probabilistic inference algorithms
3. **Visualization Module**: Custom plotting and animation capabilities

### Bayesian Network Construction
Networks are defined using a graph-based representation where:
- **Nodes**: Represent random variables with discrete states
- **Edges**: Represent conditional dependencies
- **CPTs**: Conditional probability tables defining P(X|Parents(X))

### Inference Algorithms
The system implements multiple inference approaches:

1. **Exact Inference**:
   - Variable Elimination
   - Belief Propagation (for tree-structured networks)
   - Junction Tree Algorithm

2. **Approximate Inference**:
   - Gibbs Sampling
   - Particle Filtering
   - Loopy Belief Propagation

### Visualization Techniques
- **Network Topology**: Interactive graph visualization using NetworkX and Plotly
- **CPT Visualization**: Heatmap representations of conditional probabilities
- **Inference Heatmaps**: Color-coded belief updates across network states
- **Belief Propagation**: Animated visualization of message passing

The system provides multiple levels of interpretability:

### Local Explanations
- **Evidence Impact Analysis**: Shows how specific evidence affects each node's beliefs
- **Sensitivity Analysis**: Quantifies the influence of CPT parameters on inference results
- **Counterfactual Reasoning**: Explores "what-if" scenarios for different evidence

### Global Explanations
- **Network Structure Analysis**: Identifies key variables and their connectivity patterns
- **Influence Diagrams**: Visualizes the flow of information through the network
- **Dependency Analysis**: Highlights strong and weak probabilistic relationships

### Clinical/Scientific Relevance
- **Medical Networks**: Explain diagnostic reasoning and treatment decisions
- **Risk Assessment**: Quantify uncertainty in decision-making processes
- **Educational Value**: Demonstrate probabilistic concepts through interactive examples

## ⚗️ Experiments & Evaluation
